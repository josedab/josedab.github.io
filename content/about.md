Hi there :wave:

My name is **Jos√© David Baena** and you reached my personal site.
Here, you can find a bit more information about me, my interests and what I value.

## A little about myself
Originally from Spain, currently living in **San Francisco** :bridge_at_night:, married to an Italian and have an amazing baby (born in the USA). It is a bit of the united nations around here :earth_americas:.

I like to be in a room where I feel the dumbest (meaning lot of room for learning) and always open to new opportunities to grow :muscle:. 


## Professional experience
I have been working as a Software Engineer for research projects, startups and big companies. Worked mostly as a Full Stack engineer, although based on my experience, I prefer to be focused on the backend. In particular, I love architecture problems and wondering how to scale the next big thing from 0 to millions of requests.

At the moment, you can find me working at **GitHub**, where I enjoy working with some of the smartest people I know.

## Personal interests
At work and when I have free time, I try to focus my time on my family and:
### Tech interests
- **Machine Learning**: It's an exciting time for Machine learning. Now that there is an ongoing wave of optimized CPUs an GPUs (as well as availability of these in the cloud) to run the ML algorithms, there are several discoverements done every day :tada:. I think we are at a stage where the entry barrier is lower than ever and you can accomplish a lot in a short time window.

- **Performance tuning**: Performance tuning is an art :art:. Sometimes it is not worth it but when you can reduce resources/query times/&lt;insert bottleneck issue here &gt; by double digits percentage, you start seeing the benefits and eventually getting expertise. Troubleshooting for these has been always fun to me and in my experience where I learn the most.

- **Distributed systems**: I am fascinated by systems that cooperatively achieve a specific function (could be storage, processing, you name it :sparkles:)
I like to code POC for these, and have a look to current implementations, being Kafka my favourite system so far.

- **RAD development**: Rapid Application Development is to me a multiplication factor in development productivity. Specially, code generation for boilerplates has been always a topic I have raised when something is taking more time than usual that is not business logic. Huge fan of [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/).

### Outside tech
- :men_wrestling: **Brazillian Jiu Jitsu**: When I am not coding, I am mostly thinking in BJJ. This has been my main passion outside work and have been doing it now for a while. When I travel for work, I also make sure I have some time to visit a local academy and mingle with the locals :)
- :hamburger: **Food**: More than cooking, eating it. Love to eat food from different cultures, being my favourite the Szechuan cuisine. Having said that, if you live aroudn San Francisco, you should check out [Mission Chinese Food](https://www.missionchinesefood.com/san-francisco).


## Projects
:warning: This area is still in development, so please come back in the future! :warning:

Here are some projects I have worked outside work on my free time:
- **Netflix Conductor**: (Significant contributions) a workflow management system part of the Netflix OSS ecosystem.
- **JHipster**: (Single contribution) a code generator for Spring Boot + React applications.
- **Utiltube**: Metadata Service associated to videos. Think about data enhancement for video experiences.
- **API Daas**: Api data as a Service platform. Declarative apis for RAD development.

## Contact
I am always interested in knowing other people in the sector or with potential interest in tech. I am trying as well to build a diverse network where I can help/be helped. If there is anything you need help with, feel free to drop me an email at `josedab at gmail dot com`.

{{< admonition type=note title="Replying to messages" open=true >}}
Sometimes, like everyone else, I get busy at **life** and I might take some time to reply. However, I will do my best to reply every message in a timely manner.
