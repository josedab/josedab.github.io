Hi there! :wave:

My name is José David and you ended up on my personal site. First of all, I hope you ended up here because you were looking for something and found it :joy:.

## Motivation
The main reason I decided to start a blog was to document thoughts, ideas, interests I have on a daily basis. 

I normally write these ideas on Evernote. However, after reading [Max Stoiber](https://mxstbr.com/) notes about [Working in public](https://notes.mxstbr.com/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=Work_in_public)), I got inspired to start sharing them publicly.

In addition, I am a strong believer of teaching what I learn (or in this case writing it), as it is a good way to recall your learnings.

Students **who spend time teaching** what they’ve learned go on to show **better understanding** and knowledge retention than students who simply spend the same time re-studying.

## Content of this site
This site will contain mostly information/challenges I face in the Software Engineering field. Most of the content will be technical in some degree, although lot of the times I will talk about the concepts with a link to the GitHub repository.

## Content frequency
My aim is to write at least once a month. I put a low entry requirement, and if I like this writing adventure I will increase it. For the moment, I want to focus this as a writing/learning experience and not an obligation.
