From Wikipedia:
> Juneteenth is a holiday celebrating the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. Originating in Texas, it is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States, with varying official recognition. 

The meaning is that it represents the emancipation of the last remaining enslaved African Americans in the Confederacy.

## GitHub and Juneteenth
GitHub invited all employees to listen, learn, engage, and participate on a global **Day Of Learning on Juneteenth**.
While a company has the option of not doing anything about it (it is not an official holiday at the moment), or give the day as a day off, I think GitHub approach is the most effective for Juneteenth.

I have seen several initiatives across GitHub that made me super proud of working for this company: from book club meetings to Empathy Circles to perspective sharing through issues. Up to this day, I am still amazed by how Hubbers(GitHub employees) are involved in these subjects and I have to say, it has changed me as a person for a better good :smile:.

This is the main reason I am writing this post today: I decided that, as part of this opportunity that GitHub gave me, I was going to make a plan to be more aware of:
- This day in American history.
- Understanding/reading more about the challenges the black community suffers up to this day. 

## My plan for Juneteenth
As a white male, I cannot even imagine what the black community has gone through. One of the things I wanted to do during Juneteenth was first to understand what the day meant, and second, based on most recent events in the world, I wanted to get a bit deeper into how racism/discrimination is in our everyday lives. Being aware/understanding more about this will help for being [an effective ally](https://guidetoallyship.com/).

### Easy reads on the gram
Here are some grams shared by a coworker that I found easy and super helpful to read:

1. Staying out of politics is a privilege in action.

### Teaching discrimination
As racism is engrained into the culture, I was interested in knowing how you can teach the discrimination concept in schools and found this video which is gold :ok_hand:

This video hit me, and I think the teacher does an amazing job of showcasing discrimination.
When you see the video, you would think this happens only to kids (as they usually are a sponge of what they see at home), but It turns out the same technique applies to adults:

### Books to read
One of the action items for this Juneteenth was to do a bit more research about which books to add to my shelf and commit to reading them. I found a couple I would be reading over the next weeks:

|  White Fragility  | So you want to talk about race |

I will let you know how it goes :)

## Summary
I decided to share with the Internet some of my thoughts during Juneteenth. While I think this is more of an archive for me to go back and add more things to share with the world, I hope someone in a similar situation to mine found this reading useful and use this as a first step towards becoming an effective ally. If there is any reading you should do after this, you should check out [Guide to Allyship](https://guidetoallyship.com/).
